### React Axios Task

## Task Description:

Create a React App that allows for CRUD operations with user data using React and Axios fetch to interact with a mock API.

Mock API URL : https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users

## Note: Instead of the above URL, I had used the mock-API - https://6633a294f7d50bbd9b4a24d3.mockapi.io/Todo

I had to create the above mock API as I couldn't perform the CRUD operations using the URL provided in the Task.

## Requirements:

Display all the existing API data in UI using Axios.
Users should be able to perform CRUD operations on user data, including adding, editing, and deleting user records.
The user data should be stored in a mock API that can be accessed using Axios fetch.
The UI should have a clean and responsive design that is easy to use and navigate.

## Deliverables:

A working React application that meets the above requirements.
The application should be well-documented, including code comments and a README file that describes how to run the application.
The code should be submitted in a Git repository, with a clear commit history that demonstrates the development process.
